# Flask-SocketIO with eventlet

It is easiest to run using:
```
$ export FLASK_ENV=production
# or
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
This runs eventlet simply because it is installed in the venv (!).

Run flask served by eventlet's production server:
Run manually:
```
$ python index.py
```
production mode only?.
